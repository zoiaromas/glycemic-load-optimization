# Diet Problem - Glycemic Load (GL) Optimization

## Project overview

This project is focused on optimizing the glycemic index for different diet scenarios. It was performed as part of a university course, the project uses **SAS Viya** for linear programming and optimization techniques.

### Datasets:
The analysis includes various scenarios, such as:
1. **Scenario 1**: Female diet with different food components.
2. **Scenario 2**: Female diet with adjustments for caloric intake, fats, proteins, etc.
3. **Scenario 3**: Female diet with additional dietary fibers.
4. **Scenario 4**: Vegetarian diet scenario with similar nutritional objectives.
5. **Scenario 5**: Vegan diet scenario focusing on fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

### Problem description

The goal of the project is to optimize the glycemic load (GL) while keeping other nutritional values in mind. Using the dataset from various diet types, the project performs linear programming optimization and adjusts the diet to achieve the desired glycemic load with minimal deviation from specified nutritional limits.

### File list:

- `diet_optimization.sas`: Contains the SAS code for the optimization model.
- `report.pdf`: A report outlining the details of the analysis and the results (written in Polish).

### Notes:
The report and code comments are written in **Polish**.
